I am a 1st year PhD student at the University of WÃ¼rzburg where I am jointly supervised by Prof. Goran Glavas and Prof. Radu Timofte.
My research interests are at the intersection of NLP and CV in multimodal vision+language problems.

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in computer science at the Technical University of Darmstadt in 2021, 
where I wrote my thesis at the UKP lab under the supervision of [Jonas Pfeiffer](https://pfeiffer.ai/) and 
[Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp), and then stayed at the group for a year as a research intern.
