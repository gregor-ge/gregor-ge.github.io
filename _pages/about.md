I am a researcher at the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab led by Iryna Gurevych at the Technical University of Darmstadt.
My main research interests are NLP and machine learning. 
I am particularly interested in cross-lingual, multimodal vision+language, and few-shot settings.
My current research project is about the classification of memes.

Previously, I completed my masterâ€™s in computer science at the Technical University of Darmstadt, where I wrote my thesis under the supervision of [Jonas Pfeiffer](https://pfeiffer.ai/) and [Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp). 
The results of my thesis can be found in [Retrieve Fast, Rerank Smart: Cooperative and Joint Approaches for Improved Cross-Modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11920).
